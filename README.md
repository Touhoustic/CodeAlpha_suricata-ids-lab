# Suricata Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment and configuration of a Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using **Suricata**.  
The system detects common network attacks and suspicious activity and automatically blocks malicious IP addresses.

## Environment

* Attacker: Kali Linux
* Victim / IDS: Lubuntu
* IDS Engine: Suricata 8.0.2
* Network Mode: Bridged Adapter

## Features

* Real-time traffic inspection
* Emerging Threats rule set
* Custom Suricata rules
* Detection of ICMP, Nmap scans, and SSH brute-force attempts
* Automatic IP blocking using iptables
* Alert logging via fast.log

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how Suricata can be used to detect and respond to network attacks in real time.

Visualization dashboards were considered optional, and analysis was performed directly using Suricata log files.
